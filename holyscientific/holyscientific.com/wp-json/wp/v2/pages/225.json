The Kjeldahl Distillation cum digestion Units have a minimum of 3 mantles and a maximum of 6 mantles which are made of a knitted layer of glass fabric combined with flexible heating element, encased in Mild Steel Housing. Over and above this layer of glass fabric accommodating the flexible heater, another layer of glass cloth is placed on the lower mantle, held firmly by a circular aluminum rim to hold the mantle in position and also ensuring the safety of the Heaters. These mantles are designed so as to hold any size of R.B. Flasks from 250ml to 500ml capacity. (Higher capacity is also available on request).<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h4>MODE OF HEATING :-<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to the above, these units are provided with a fume duct made of PVC or S.S ( As per model.), having holes to accommodate the necks of the flasks.
