We specialize in both standard and customized models of bio safety cabinet , specifically designed to meet the challenging demands of various scientists for individual and specialized research applications. Over a short period of time <strong>RASAYAN brand<\/strong> have been established as reliable exporters of bio safety cabinet in India. Apart from that we are supplying our bio safety cabinet in India, catering to a variety of customers ranging from Defense Installations, Research Laboratories, Educational Institutes, pharmaceuticals and various R and D laboratories of leading national and multinational companies.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h4>MODE OF HEATING :-<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The front panels of bio safety cabinet are detachable and easier to remove for filter. Visible windows with anti ultraviolet toughened glass or clear acrylic or clear poly carbonate sheet and the height of glass can be adjustable easily due to counter balance facility. If the height is higher than safe level, the audible and visual alarm will be opened &amp; blower cut off till door not come at safe level. The cabinet all manufactured by pharmaceutical approved 304 grade stainless steel OR mild steel OR aluminum and the left, right and back bins of cabinet are manufactured together with arc angle will make easier to clean the side of cabinet. A control panel is provided with various controlling switches lick mains <strong>ON\/OFF U.V &amp; florescent (if opted.) light ON\/OFF switch cord plug, manometer for flow,<\/strong> etc. Fully PLC based controlling available at extra cost with air flow rate controlling.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h4>Other Details:-<\/h4>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text]<div class=\"standard-arrow list-divider bullet-top\"><div class=\"products_box\">\n<ul>\n<li>Contaminated Pressure Plenum: Negative Unitized drain pan beneath the work surface allows best arm positions the user\u2019s lap.<\/li>\n<li>The airflow design creates a more impenetrable air barrier or momentum air curtain at the front of the cabinet, increasing the cabinet\u2019s protective capabilities and avoiding cross infection.<\/li>\n<li>With strong wind form the draught intake in side of cabinet, which will clear the round airflow up in lateral cabinet and prohibit the moving of contamination.<\/li>\n<li>High efficiency filter system: input and output of air will be filtrated by ULPA filter and its efficiency is more than 99.97%.
