The shaker is also widely used for shaking solutions in Erlenmeyer flasks. We are providing different types of Rotary Shakers clamps in different quantities. Brush less or brush (As per model.) induction motor installed in the Rotary Shakers is ideally maintenance free. Step less electronic frequency control ensures gentle stat and maintains preset speed in the shaker. We also offer variable speed digital meter with speed regulator, as per client\u2019s requirement. The standard models have orbital diameter of 35mm and shaking speed of 50 to 300 RPM. The automatic restart at present makes work easy. Widely applicable for research on bacteria cultivation, fermentation, hybridization, chemical and biochemical reaction, enzymes and tissues research, which have a high requirement on precision of shaking speed and temperature.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h4>MODE OF HEATING :-<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our Orbital Shaker are double walled convection heated and cooled units. Outer body of our Orbital Shaker are constructed out of thick PCRC sheet duly pre-treated with primers and rust proofing and painted with long lasting stove enamel or elegantly powder coated.. The inner chamber is made of heavy gauge stainless steel sheet of SS-304 grade. The gap between the walls is filled high grade mineral glass wool, which ensures maximum thermal efficiency in our Orbital Shaker. The unit is provided with two doors, the inner door is made of thick plexi glass\/float glass, to view the specimens without disturbing the temperature of the chamber. This door is provided with magnetic door closer. The outer door is made of mild steel sheet lined with stainless steel from inside.. This door is provided with lock and key arrangement. The unit is mounted on a sturdy steel frame and provided with castor wheels for easy movement inside the laboratory. The unit is provided with two\/three stainless steel shelves. The triple walled back of our Orbital Shaker are provided with two air circulation fans for uniform maintenance of the temperature throughout the chamber.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h4>Other Details:-<\/h4>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text]<div class=\"standard-arrow list-divider bullet-top\"><ul>\n<li><strong>Shaking Platform:<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The standard model of our orbital shaker has a plat form size of 500mm x 500mm and it can withhold 16-20 flasks of 250ml or 500 ml.
