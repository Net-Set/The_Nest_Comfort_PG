The heat of combustion is an important quantity since the combustion of fuels forms the main source of energy for industrial and domestic purposes. Combustion is always accompanied by the evolution of heat. The amount of heat evolved when one mole of a substance is burned completely in oxygen is known as the heat of combustion (or enthalpy change of combustion). For practical purpose, the relative effectiveness of a fuel is expressed more often in terms of its calorific value which is the amount of heat evolved per kilogram of the substance. With the help of bomb calorimeter user can easily determine the calorific value of solid and liquid combustible materials.

Fuels such as coal and oil must meet regulations specifying the total calorific value, quality and purity of the fuel. Liquid fuels like gasoline and kerosene are also tested by <strong>bomb calorimetry<\/strong>. The measure of energy give-off by the fuel is determined by the fuel\u2019s heat of combustion.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Metabolic Studies:<\/strong> Bomb calorimeter can be used to determine the calorie content of a product.<br \/>\nThis process is used in food and metabolic studies to examine the effects of energy content in food on humans and animals. These studies have implications that extend into nutritional considerations and health concerns regarding the effects of diet on the body.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Propellant and Explosive Testing:<\/strong> Propellants and explosives are tested using a bomb<br \/>\ncalorimeter to find each product\u2019s heat of detonation. Propellants typically burn predictably at a steady rate, while explosives are unstable and exert a huge amount of pressure with the induction of the chemical reaction \u2014 information about both of these processes are identified with bomb calorimetry.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Waste and Refuse Disposal:<\/strong> The cement industry is one of several industries that use hazardous<br \/>\nwaste as an alternative fuel.
