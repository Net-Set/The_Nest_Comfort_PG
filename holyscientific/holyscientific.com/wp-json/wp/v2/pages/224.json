The rotating field may be created either by a rotating magnet or a set of stationary electromagnets, placed beneath the vessel with the liquid. Magnetic stirrers often include a hot plate or some other means for heating the liquid. Magnetic stirrers are often used in chemistry and biology. They are preferred over gear-driven motorized stirrers because they are quieter, more efficient, and have no moving external parts to break or wear out (other than the simple bar magnet itself). Due to its small size, a stirring bar is more easily cleaned and sterilized than other stirring devices. They do not require lubricants which could contaminate the reaction vessel and the product. They can be used inside hermetically closed vessels or systems, without the need for complicated rotary seals.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h4>MODE OF HEATING :-<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A compact stirring device utilizing a rotating field of magnetic induction. Variable speed stirring action with either closed or open vessels. Stirring is accomplished by means of small rotor, sealed in alkali or acid resistant polythene which is placed in the liquid to be stirred and capable of rotation by magnetic field applied from below the container. The speed is variable and is controlled by speed controller fitted with thermostatic control. Heavy gauge mild steel body finished with polyester powder coating for durability. Solid aluminium hotplate combined with glass fiber insulation give rapid heat up, good temperature control, and minimal temperature variation or fluctuation. Stainless steel baffle and air space maintains body at a safe handling temperature. The element is an in alloy type for easy replacement. Heating is controlled by a simmer stat with 0-10 knob for easy setting. Temperature range is from 50\u00b0C to 250\u00b0C. Temperature will drop slightly with stirrer on, and is dependent on load.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h4>Other Details:-<\/h4>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text]<div class=\"standard-arrow list-divider bullet-top\"><p><strong>Features<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>All the features of competitive products for thousands of rupees less.<\/li>\n<li>Permanently lubricated, brushless drive provides long, trouble-free operation<\/li>\n<li>Cast-aluminum body is designed for stability and water resistance<\/li>\n<li>Milled aluminum or M.S top provides superior temperature uniformity &amp; durability.<\/li>\n<li>Stirring hot plates available with aluminum, M.S. or ceramic top plates choose ceramic for higher temperatures<\/li>\n<li>Corrosion-resistant ceramic top is mounted in a cast-aluminum frame for cooler edges<\/li>\n<li>Hot plate heats to (2500C) in approximately.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Temperature Control \/ Range:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Temperature Range :+5 \u00b0C to 250C<\/li>\n<li>Temperature Sensitivity :\u00a0+\/- 1\u00b0 c or better.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>REVOLUTION<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maximum rpm: 1200<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>[\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;693&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; onclick=&#8221;custom_link&#8221; img_link_target=&#8221;_blank&#8221; image_hovers=&#8221;false&#8221; link=&#8221;\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/megnatic-stirrer-with-hot-plate.pdf&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text] SCOPE :- HOLYSCIENTIFIC is one of the leading science equipment manufacturer &amp; exporter of science equipments, science instruments, lab equipments, lab instruments, testing equipments, testing instruments, like Digital bio-safety cabinet, vertical &amp; horizontal laminar air flow cooling &amp; heating instruments like ultra low temperature deep freezers, BOD incubators, hot air oven, muffle furnace,&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":812,"parent":0,"menu_order":10,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/holyscientific.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/224"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/holyscientific.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/holyscientific.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/holyscientific.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/holyscientific.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=224"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/holyscientific.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/224\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/holyscientific.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/812"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/holyscientific.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=224"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/holyscientific.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=224"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/holyscientific.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=224"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
