For this purpose, the high temperature muffle furnace steps in as the necessary part of laboratory equipment. RASAYAN providing the muffle furnace at a affordable cost. The sizes of the muffle furnace are various from the smaller furnaces which are conveniently placed on a workbench, to the larger ones that has a coveted capacity and competent for all duties. APPLICATION: Our furnace are usually heated for achieve desired temperature by conduction convection or upper body radiation from electrical heating elements. Therefore there is no combustion involved in the temperature controlled in the system which allows much greater control of temperature uniformity &amp; assure isolation of the material being heated from the by product from the fuel combustion<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h4>MODE OF HEATING :-<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">CONSTRUCTION: Rasayan muffle furnace is double walled convection heated unit. Outer body of the unit are made of heavy gauge CRC sheet duly pretreated with primers rust free well finished powder coated. The inner chamber made of special design ceramic material.
