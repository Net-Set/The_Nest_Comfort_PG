For a better convenience this equipment is supported by an on\/off switch with a plug and cord. The RASAYAN mantle is the most compact mantle with an M.S or S.S shell that can heat flasks up to 10 liters. This mantle has a durable M.S or S.S housing outside and resilient glass fabric inside to support flasks and protect flask walls from thermal strain. Only the bottom of the flask is covered so the contents being heated are fully visible. The mantle is grounded through the aluminum housing and requires a support as shown below. We bring forth a wide variety of Heating Mantles which are extensively used in laboratories to apply heat to containers. Our <strong>Laboratory Heating Mantle<\/strong> is available with a sturdy aluminum body. Its epoxy powder finish makes it a distinguished product. The Heating mantle which we offer is best suited for round bottom flask. Proper electric wiring makes certain that no short circuit takes place. The high temperature range of 2500C degrees Celsius makes our Heating Mantles ideal for industrial use. We are a leading company engaged in <strong>Flexible Fabric Heating Mantles Manufacturing in Ahmadabad.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h4>MODE OF HEATING :-<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These mantels are used for non hazardous safe areas. Mantels are designed to cover flasks at the equator and to heat the flask uniformly. These can be used to heat liquids up to 300oC. Heating elements are perfectly insulated by glass sleeving &amp; ceramic beads.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h4>Other Details:-<\/h4>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text]<div class=\"standard-arrow list-divider bullet-top\"><div class=\"products_box\"><strong>FEATURES<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aluminum body with epoxy powder coat finish.<\/li>\n<li>Fiber glass net with long lasting nichrome heating element.<\/li>\n<li>High grade glass wool insulation.<\/li>\n<li>Suitable for round bottom flask.<\/li>\n<li>Energy regulator with corresponding lamp indicator to control the temperature.<\/li>\n<li>Temperature Range: Up to 250<sup>0<\/sup>C degrees Celsius.<\/li>\n<li>Digital temperature display.
