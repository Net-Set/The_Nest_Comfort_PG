When used properly, it exhausts toxic, offensive or flammable materials when the contaminants of an experimental of procedure fail &amp; vapors or dust escape from the apparatus being used. Safety in the Laboratory is a primary concern. The Supreme air series of fume hoods meet the challenge with a high degree of efficiency. A wide variety of models and comprehensive option packages have been designed to enable you to tailor your fume hood to a specific application.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h4>MODE OF HEATING :-<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">RASAYAN Fuming hood Are available with variety of lining and work surface like SS (316), PVC, Ceramic tiles polypropylene etc. Our fume hood is equipped with thick glass sash suspended on safe device. It is provided with counter balance load for easy up and down movement. RASAYAN fume hoods Are aerodynamically designed which provides most efficient airflow to the suction. double wall construction which provides easy maintenance, access to service like Water gas, electricity etc. Are Provided with support base having provision for air vent connection to evacuate tapped chemical vapor inside. Cool white florescent provided at the top for clear vision inside working area.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h4>Other Details:-<\/h4>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text]<div class=\"standard-arrow list-divider bullet-top\"><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our fume hoods are provided with switch for easy starting of the centrifugal fan &amp; illumination light.
