A gap of 75 mm. filled with good<\/strong> quality of insulated material in between the inner and outer chamber has been kept to prevent loss of temperature due to environmental condition. Perforated shelves, made of S.S. have been provided to get the temperature uniformity in all around the chamber and to place the sample on it. Heating element of 2000 watt (wattage may vary depending upon the size\/volume of the ovens) has been fitted in all the three sides to heat the inner chamber uniformly. Blower (if opted), fitted with best quality heavy motor has been provided to circulate the inside air to make the inside environment uniform and also to provide forced dry air to the samples to get dry sooner and uniformly. Exhaust holes have also been provided at the sides of the incubator to release the pressure due to hot air.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;506&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; style=&#8221;vc_box_border&#8221; image_hovers=&#8221;false&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These holes may also be used to calibrate\/validate the incubators. Temperature inside the chamber is controlled precisely with the help of a thermostat\/microprocessor based Digital Temperature Controller cum Indicator, which is provided on the panel and its temperature probe (PT \u2013100) is placed inside the chamber to view the temperature inside the chamber.
