A wedding encourages you to make a bold declaration and wear something special, enjoyable and unexpected, unlike your usual office gathering. That's how novice wedding guests think, at least.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is, a soon-to-be-married couple can never be overshadowed by your style. A wedding is a formal affair, and a perfect level of sophistication is inferred. The etiquette, however, refers not only to the option of dress code for the bride and groom but also to you as their guest.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Styling for the whole attire of head-to-toe wedding guests can also be daunting. For this cause, you must show the couple your respect as a visitor, which means you still ought to look your best. Between your outfit, shoes, clutch, accessories, make-up and hair, find the right look appropriately. And when it comes to buying jewellery on someone's wedding day, in order to pick the right pieces, you should follow those basic rules, which also ensures that you owe the couple the best effort.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s get started with the guide: -</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Avoid Statement Pieces :</span></h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You must always keep in mind when attending a wedding that the celebration is all about the couple getting married. Jewellery that sticks out should be left by the bride and not by the visitor to be worn. Wear jewellery for wedding guest jewellery that does not draw too much attention. You should wear trendy pieces, just make sure you don't overdo it to the extent where the bride is taking the limelight.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You must always bear in mind when attending a wedding that the celebration is all about the couple getting married. It is appropriate to leave jewellery that sticks out to be worn by the bride and not the guest. Wear jewellery for wedding guest jewellery that does not draw too much attention. You should wear beautiful pieces, just make sure that you don't overdo it to the extent that the bride is taking the limelight.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Turn To Pearls :</span></h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These classic beauties are making a comeback in a major way, but pearls are always a smart idea if you're trying to dress for a variety of nuptial celebrations. Did we note that, indeed, a declaration can be made by pearls? Not to mention their versatility and the fact that both subtle and bright colours play well with them. Arm yourself with a pair of pearl statement earrings and a pearl necklace, and all season long, you'll be the classiest wedding guest.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Choose Classic Pieces :</span></h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the wedding theme itself is unconventional, select traditional accessories and strive not to overdo them. Stop chunky bracelets and stick to tiny pendants and stud earrings. With diamonds reserved for the bride, the perfect and most tasteful item to wear as a wedding guest might just be timeless pearls. For your personal preference, such jewellery etiquette of be shy, but practising it is for the finest. That is the whole point of dress codes, after all, to allow the bride and groom to shine.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Bonus Tips: -</span></h2>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don't get too matchy-matchy at all stages. Many women also love matching their heels to their bag with their nail <a href="https://www.voylla.com/?utm_source=voylla-blog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=anchor-text">jewellery</a>. Although this is not inaccurate, it is clearly dull and obsolete. Try to have fun with colours that clash.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fit each of your jewellery wonderfully with your coat. If your frock has a lot of details, prints, and colours, go for minimal jewels. You certainly don't need a necklace if your dress is high-necked and opt instead for a bracelet and earrings.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mix and match the numerous jewellery styles and colours, depending on whether it's day or night. For the marriage ceremony, opt for delicate silver or pearl earrings, and offer lighter, more dazzling colours to the evening reception of stones or gold.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pair your bright, colourful jewellery with conservative clothes if you are looking for a bit of a cheerful touch. Meaning, you can jazz it up with jewellery that helps you to express yourself whether your dress is plain and simple, whether by its colours or designs.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, try swapping your statement items with event-appropriate accessories the next time you get invited to a wedding. In reality, jewellery etiquette lets you make the most beautiful fashion decision without coming off as tasteless or as if the bride and groom were trying to outshine you.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully, with all of your upcoming appearances, our wedding guest jewellery tips will help you dress your ensemble. In addition to keeping in mind the wishes of the brides and grooms, just remember to choose pieces that reflect your personal style and make you feel relaxed. Besides, with some beautiful jewellery to match, you might still have fun and make the most of all those hair and nail appointments!</span>

It’s this time of the year where you will be able to try out many new dresses and add them to your wardrobe. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So let us look at the 11 top outfits for summer that you should definitely try out.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>1. Shorts Outfits:</strong> This outfit is the most popular of all time. Pair up your shorts with a cute t-shirt or any floral kind of shirt.

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>11. Off-Shoulder Dress:</strong> sometimes people don’t like sleeveless. So instead you can try the famous off-shoulder dress to get a similar kind of look.

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16365" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Untitled-design-2021-03-05T165059.155.png" alt="" width="940" height="788"></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some extra suggestions:</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose light-toned dresses during summer.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Maxis and floral gowns are better than regular denim and trousers.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sandals are the best option for high heels.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Own a pair of white sneakers because they can be easily paired up with any outfit. Despite being so simple, white sneakers never go out of style.</span>]]>

    <title>How To Protect Your Favorite Jewellery From Tarnishing!!</title>

      <![CDATA[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16344" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-198.png" alt="" width="818" height="621">
You have inherited the jewelry collection of your grandmother and now you are sorting it along with your own collection. You've noted, though, that some of these collars, bracelets, or earrings are beginning to tarnish and rust. This is the normal path of certain pieces, which can cause corrosion and residue on older pieces of jewelry because of moisture and oxygen. Learning how to protect items from the weather will make all the difference as the rust can be washed up and how to keep and clean the jewelry going forward.
There are many places for jewelry to be stored, but did you know that some of them are harmful? A few factors, such as the materials used, the type of jewelry, and the value of the jewelry, depending on the right way to store jewelry.
Where you store jewelry is a personal preference in some situations. Do you prefer to see or keep it out of sight with your jewels on display? In the shower or in the den, can you take off your jewelry? Regardless of your tastes, to secure your jewels, there are certain suggestions you can remember.
<h2>Keep It Dry :</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16345" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Keep-It-Dry.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="490">
By interaction with moisture and liquids, the easiest way to tarnish your jewels is This entails lotions, rubbing your hands, a spritz of perfume, and sweating with your jewels on. The plating and metals will break off even the oils on your skin over time - and this can again differ from person to person. Will an accident leave your jewels wet? Right now, make sure to wash and dry them clean!
<h2>Separate Jewellery By Metal :</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16346" title="Separate Jewellery By Metal" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Separate-Jewellery-By-Metal.jpg" alt="Separate Jewellery By Metal" width="800" height="800">
Do an inventory of your jewels first. Create a few piles of fine jewelry, costume jewelry, and silver jewelry that are separate. Costume jewelry should be kept away from silver and fine jewelry, and silver jewelry should be kept away from fine jewelry. When they communicate with each other, this distinction helps keep the metals from tarnishing.
<h2>Try A Jewellery Protectant Spray :</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16347" title="Try A Jewellery Protectant Spray" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jewellery-Protectant-Spray.jpg" alt="Try A Jewellery Protectant Spray" width="740" height="553">
In order to overcome the elements that lead to tarnishing, give your jewels a defensive shield. Not only does it cover your favorite items longer, but some sprays can also protect you from reactions that our extra allergic girls get to costume jewelry, such as itching, rashes, and hives!
A variety of sealant sprays are available at most craft and hardware venues. Others are made with a silicone base, while others use a number of different materials. A buffer between water, oxygen, and your piece is created by spraying your jewelry and allowing the coat a chance to dry thoroughly. Prior to rusting or tarnishing, this would mean more time. It can also totally preclude the operation.
<h2>Use Clear Nail Polish :</h2>
Costume jewelry may be decorated with clear nail polish, such as bracelets, necklaces, and broaches. Be prepared to regularly reapply the substance; sometimes, it can flake off. However, between skin, jewelry, and the environment, the polish provides another form of barrier. This method would also prevent ample oxidation of costume jewelry to make the skin green.
<h2>Store Them In Closed Containers :</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16348 size-full" title="Store Them In Closed Containers" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/jewellery-container.jpg" alt="Store Them In Closed Containers" width="683" height="512">
It will help to reduce the amount of moisture and oxygen that makes contact with it by storing jewelry in closed boxes and containers. Jewelry is usually worn only during the day and only for a limited number of days each year. This suggests that the amount of time spent in storage is strong compared to the amount of time spent on pieces. By protecting against rain, taking the time to invest in a closed container will significantly add to the life of your pieces.
<h2>Regular Clean Your Jewellery :</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16349 size-full" title="Regular Clean Your Jewellery " src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/jewellery-cleaning.png" alt="Regular Clean Your Jewellery " width="800" height="420">
Periodically, different remedies, foams, and pastes are available for cleaning jewelry. In a bowl filled with the mixture, solutions require dipping clothing, while foams require scrubbing with a small brush, and pastes need hardening before rinsing off. If you are uncertain of how the cleaning agent will respond to your necklace, badge, earrings, or bracelets, feel free to do it in a small area before finishing the procedure. Keep note of pieces that fit really well with your jewelry and make it easier to find them in the future.

There are many St. Valentine's tales, and these stories have developed into the legend we know today over time. It wasn't until more than 200 years later that St Valentine's Day was declared on February 14. Rome had been Christian by this time, and the Catholic Church was eager to root out all residual paganism. In February each year, a pagan fertility rite was performed and the Pope abolished this festival and instituted Saint Valentine's Day on 14 February, thus creating this feast day on the Catholic Calendar of Saints.
<h2>How is Valentine’s day celebrated today?</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-16318 alignnone" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Valentines-Day-Celebration.jpg" alt="valentine-day-celebration" width="2240" height="1260">Although Valentine's Day is celebrated in most countries, this festival has created its own rituals with various cultures. Valentine's Day is celebrated in some parts of the world as a day to share affection between family members and friends, rather than between romantic couples. Some rituals include leaving children with lollies and presents and some involve acts of affection for peers.

With loving letters to loved ones, or <a href="https://www.voylla.com/gifts">Gifts</a> of roses or something interesting that can surprise your love are sent and couples enjoy special time together.
Most couples want to have brunch, a <strong>picnic or a special home-cooked</strong> meal to celebrate Valentine's Day. Another common tradition on Valentine's Day is to relax in a <strong>beautiful location</strong> in a luxurious hotel stay, allowing a couple to get away from it all and spend some quality time together. On Valentine's Day, <strong>marriage proposals</strong> are often common, and it is also selected as the ideal day to share their love and devotion. Any marriage proposals, such as after hiking to the top of a mountain or putting a sign on a billboard, are delivered very creatively. Marriage proposals made on Valentine's Day are usually sweet and unforgettable, whatever the process.

      <![CDATA[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16244 size-full" title="Diwali festival of india " src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/diwali-festival-of-india.jpg" alt="Diwali festival of india " width="1200" height="630">
Diwali is one of India's most famous festivals. It is celebrated throughout the length and breadth of the country with great fanfare and enthusiasm. Diwali is a 5-day celebration, popular as the "Festival of Lights," where friends and families come together, light "Diyas" or earthen lamps in their homes, enjoy sweet delicacies, exchange gifts, play games, and burn crackers.
On'Amavasya 'or no moon night, the festival is observed and, according to the Hindu calendar, heralds the dawn of the New Year. It is a key to new beginnings, as it is believed that, in the middle of the dark night, Goddess Lakshmi pays a visit to the devotees' houses and blesses them with riches and peace. As it symbolizes the triumph of light over darkness, good over evil, and hope over despair, it is called the light festival.
<strong>Diwali will be celebrated this year on November 14, 2020 (Sunday)</strong>
<h2>The meaningful history behind Diwali you must know: -</h2>
The significance of Diwali can be traced back to ancient India. Regarding the origin of this festival, there are multiple stories. Some say it is a celebration of the marriage of Lord Vishnu to Lakshmi, the goddess of abundance. Others suggest it's a birthday for Lakshmi. The most famous belief is that Diwali celebrates the return of Lord Rama from his 14-year exile to the Kingdom of Ayodhya along with Goddess Sita and Lakshman. The people of Ayodhya illuminated the entire kingdom with earthen diyas, which gave rise to the festival of lights, to reflect the joy of their king's return.
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16246 size-full" title="Fireworks for Celebrating Diwali 2020" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/diwali-2020.png" alt="Fireworks for Celebrating Diwali 2020" width="1200" height="632">
All over the country, Hindus celebrate Deepavali — the festival of lights — with the greatest joy and excitement. Lord Ganesha and Goddess Lakshmi are worshipped in every house, along with precious things. After the puja comes to an end, devotees will share sweets and gifts among neighbors and relatives. Kids and elders burst crackers and light candles to mark this day.
From clothing and watches and accessories and crockery, nearly everything on the shelves is going to be rehauled. The aura of Diwali is so magical that people from all over the place come to see fervor in particular. Let's have a peek at the top five locations in India where the Diwali festivities have hit an all-time peak.

Diwali is a complex affair in Varanasi. In the evening, a special Ganga Aarti takes place. The river is illuminated with thousands of diyas floating along its surface. The surroundings are complete with the singing of the priests, singing prayers for the goddess Ganga and Lakshmi. Fireworks never end and the Ghats represents the magic of the surreal world. It's a sight to behold, and one of the best Diwali experiences in India.
 
<h3>3. Kolkata, West Bengal</h3>

Although the City of Joy is at its best during Durga Puja, it doesn't get any back during Diwali.

It's not only the importance of the city that takes Mumbai to the list but the visual fireworks that make the 'City of Dreams' stand out in Diwali. You must include Zaveri Bazaar, Crawford Market, and Chira Bazaar on your list as a shopper. Marine Drive is looking all the more heavenly at this time of year. The city hosts a variety of celebrity events that are fun to attend. So go, wander around the place, shop until you collapse, splurge on some mouth-watering delicacies, and forget about a week's calories.
 
<h2>Diwali Rituals</h2>
<strong>Home Decorations</strong>: Diwali celebrations begin with home decoration. People also have their houses deep-cleaned to make them more aesthetic and appealing. The decoration includes lights, diyas, and flowers. They symbolize lightness and accomplishment as they illuminate the entire world and raise up the spirits.
A big part of this festival is the creation of Rangoli, paintings rendered in color at the entrance and in the courtyards of the houses in order to welcome the goddess Laxmi.

<strong>Shopping and Gifts</strong>: Dhanteras is probably the most exciting aspect of Diwali when people go shopping for their relatives and mates. Gifting one's relatives is a great tradition in India, particularly on Diwali, when families exchange presents as a way to wish each other a year full of happiness and prosperity.

<strong>Feast</strong>: Holidays are often an integral part of every Hindu festival. Having said that, it's certainly a big Diwali practice. Families also share sweets such as jalebis, laddus, gujia, Kayu-kathli, kheer, halwa, and barfis. In addition, savory snacks, cauliflower pakora or fritters, paneer makhani, samosa, puri, and idli are served.

<strong>Fireworks</strong>: Bursting crackers on Diwali has been one of the most important rituals of this festival ever since! Right from the basic Phooljhadi to the patatakas, to the chaklis, you'll find a variety of crackers that light up the sky. However, it's important to be mindful of the surroundings, so make sure you don't burst too many of them!

    <title>Dussehra 2020: The End OF Darkness And Ravana.</title>

      <![CDATA[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-15110" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ravan2.jpg" alt="ravan quotes" width="800" height="692">
Dussehra, one of the Hindu community's most important festival, celebrates the glorious victory of Lord Rama over the demonic tyrant, Ravana, who imprisoned Sita, Rama's queen. This day is celebrated after the completion of the nine-day-long Navratri festival, also called Vijayadashami.
Dussehra is a Sanskrit term which in English translates to 'ten (Dasha) defeat (Hara)' as it is known that there were 10 heads of the demon king Ravana. This day occurs on the 10th of the month of Ashvina, according to the Hindu calendar, which overlaps with September-October in the Gregorian calendar. Dussehra will be celebrated in 2020 on 25th October.
According to folklore, Ravan kidnapped the wife of Lord Rama, which led to a deadly battle between them. Lord Brahma offered the Demonic King Ravana the boon of being indestructible. Rama managed to kill Ravana after many events by firing an arrow through his belly-button. Therefore, every year, the 10th day of the Hindu calendar's Ashvina month is celebrated as Dussehra.
Behind this festival is one more legend. According to Mahabharat, this day commemorates the triumph of Arjuna, who alone conquered the entire Kaurava Army. Arjuna is also known as Vijaya, and therefore the day the army was destroyed is referred to as 'Vijaya Dashami.' Many citizens in the world mark this day as an opportunity to commemorate the glorious victory of goodness over darkness. Devotees in the Eastern parts of India celebrate this day as the conclusion of Durga Puja, which begins with the celebrations.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16216" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Navaratri_Navratri_Dasara_Dussehra_festival_images_and_celebrations_collage.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768">
During Navratri, prayers are offered to Goddess Durga fervently to commemorate the warrior aspect of Devi or Shakti, who represents the universe's force. Goddess Durga emerged triumphant in the 9-day war with Mahishasura, the shape-shifting, the manipulative and powerful buffalo demon. This victory is celebrated on the final 10th day, called Vijayadashami, also known as Dussehra.
<h2>Why is Navratri celebrated?</h2>
The joyous celebration of the glorious victory of good over evil is Navratri. By observing the rich customs during the festival, it welcomes divinity in all its splendour in our souls. As a gratitude, the festival honours the good seasonal harvest. It respects our everyday livelihood with the adoration of the instruments of our trade. It's also an auspicious time to launch new ideas.
It is celebrated over a 9-day cycle, creating the value of different gods and goddesses to imbibe the positive characteristics. Durga Puja and Dussehra are the culmination of the 9 Days of Festival. The festival is going to be special this year as it is going to begin right after Pitra Paksha.
The definition of Navratri is nine-night, and from October 17 this time it will be observed and will last until October 25th. Dussehra will be held on October 25/26. Nine forms of Goddess Durga are worshipped during Navratri, namely Shailaputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skanda Mata, Katyayani, Kalaratri, Mahagauri, and Siddhidatri.
<h2>How are Navratri and Dussehra celebrated?</h2>
The temples are adorned, the ritual lamps are lit, and the Vedic chants are recited. Thousands of temporary stages are erected on town squares and in temples called "Pandals." In a sanctified location at home, a pot is placed (ghatasthapana). A lamp is kept lit for nine days in a jar. The pot symbolises the cosmos. The Adishakti symbolises the uninterrupted illuminated lamp, i.e. Devi Durga. In Gujarat, people have dandiya and Garba nights that add grandeur and colour to the festival, where they dance and celebrate.
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16217" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/navratri-celebration.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="472">
There are also various customs and practises found during Dasara in northern India. One of the most famous is the Ramleela, the enactment of the Ramayana. This takes place in various sections, such as Varanasi, which has one of the oldest Ramleela communities, other regions include Agra, Rishikesh, Delhi, etc. These plays take place on an immense scale and are even a means of subsistence for many people. Another tradition that is observed in the north is to sow barley on the first day of Navrati so that it rises on the tenth day. They are then distributed for good luck.
Another Dasara ritual that is popular in other parts of the world is the burning of the effigies of Ravana in the evening. This indicates his death and the victory of good over bad. Dasara also signals the close of the summer and the start of the season.
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16218 size-full" title="ravan dahan" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ravan-dahan.jpg" alt="ravan dahan" width="720" height="540">
South India is still celebrating Dasara in its own way. The ninth day of Navratri is celebrated in Kerala as Saraswati Puja and the next day the children start their formal education. For the first time, they write on rice spread on a plate with their index finger. The elder of the family guides them through the process. Many who work in factories are doing Ayudha Puja, where they worship their machines. In Tamil Nadu, people celebrate the Golu, where dolls of gods and goddesses are used to construct daily scenes. On Dasara, a doll from the rig is symbolically put to sleep, and then the Golu is demolished after offering prayers.

<h2>Special food is eaten during Navratri</h2>
Any devotees fast during the nine days and nights of Navratri by consuming only fruit and drinking milk. They stop regular preparations made with maize, garlic and onions as part of a simple dinner. Any people eat only one meal a day.
They include Kuttu Atta, Sea Salt instead of standard table salt, Banana Chips, Aloo Tikki, Sabudana Kheer, Makhane ki sabzi, Curd, Lassi, etc.
May goddess bring light and prosperity to you and your loved ones. Thanks for reading.]]>

    <title>8 Lifestyle Gifts Ideas For A Team That Complements The Personalities OF Your Team!</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16170" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Team-gift.jpg" alt="" width="769" height="480">
Teamwork is the capacity to work for a shared vision together. The capacity to steer individual achievements against organizational goals. It is the fuel that enables ordinary individuals to achieve unusual results.
Are you looking for a wonderful gift or direct reports for your team? This guide gives you a range of <a href="https://www.voylla.com/gifts/team?utm_source=voylla-blog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=anchor-text">gift ideas for a team</a> that complements the personalities of your team. We have covered gifts for lovers of sweets, gifts for lovers of chocolate, as well as smartphone accessories to help your team be their most productive. For all their hard work, these employee gift concepts will inspire the team. Awards for appreciation have immense meaning.
Writer and lecturer Dale Carnegie once said, "People work for cash, but for appreciation, praise, and incentives go the extra mile." Employee incentives also provide an additional boost that contributes to greater productivity of workers, the synergy of teams, and overall business outcomes.
However, for employee gifts, it is important to select corporate gifts that are thoughtful, supportive, and of the highest quality. These requirements are fulfilled by the following employee gift ideas while providing an expansive range to meet the broad-ranging preferences of your team.
<h2>1. Cell phone stand:</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16171 size-full" title="Cell phone stand" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/iphone-6-plus-v16-3500-3500.jpg" alt="Cell phone stand" width="1539" height="866">
A nice stand can be used by someone who has a smartphone to make it easier to display its screen. Select a compatible mobile phone stand for both iPhone and Android phones. Without scratching the screen or body of the handset, the cushioned hooks hold the phone tightly and safely in place, and because of the angle, the stand is ideal for video chatting with family and friends, live streaming to social media, or reading texts, emails, or online recipes.
 
<h2>2. Tech gifts:</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16173 size-full" title="Tech gifts" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Tech-gifts-for-team.jpg" alt="Tech gifts" width="1200" height="800">
One of the most common gifts given this year will be tech pieces. You won't have to spend a lot of money to find a great tech gift for your workers because there is so much new technology on the market. There are inexpensive choices your workers are sure to appreciate, whether you go for the Google Nest Mini or Amazon Echo Dot.
 
<h2>3. Lifestyle gifts:</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16174 size-full" title="Lifestyle gifts" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lifestyle-gifts.jpg" alt="Lifestyle gifts" width="1500" height="1500">If your business values fitness, being healthy or being outdoors, consider getting gifts from your workers that promote this lifestyle. If your gifts are compatible with the culture of your organization, it will enhance it and make your staff feel more connected to your organization.
 
<h2>4. Event tickets:</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16175 size-full" title="event ticket gifts" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/event-ticket-gifts.jpg" alt="event ticket gifts" width="960" height="720">
Tickets to a special event illustrate that you pay attention and create a fun experience if you know your staff well enough. Such kinds of gifts may be risky because they might already have anything planned. But if it's something that you know they'd be thrilled with, then the risk could be worth it. Be sure to announce the plans in advance so that the staff can keep their timetables clear.
 
<h2>5. Vacation Getaways:</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16176" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/holidays.jpg" alt="" width="1800" height="950">
Not every business can afford to send its workers on a Hawaiian adventure, but trips are becoming increasingly common gifts of gratitude for employees. For example, the tech company FullContact is just one of several companies that give annual travel stipends to their employees. Every year, by giving each of their employees $7,500 to put towards travel, they invest in the well-being of their employees.
If you can't afford to give a first-class trip to Italy to your workers, you can always give them a top-class holiday. Take a look at local opportunities that can provide the workforce with a much-needed holiday. For example, a local bed and breakfast or a high-end resort may be perfect ways to provide less money for a quality experience.
 
<h2>6. Gift cards:</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16178 size-full" title="gift cards for team" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/gift-card.jpg" alt="gift cards for team" width="772" height="622">It's common knowledge that gift cards are enjoyed by people. Gift cards allow individuals from their favourite brands to buy whatever they want. Get to know the workers and find out what they want so that they can sell gift cards customized to their interests.
 
<h2>7. Gift A Subscription:</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16179 size-full" title="subscription gift" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/subscription-gift.jpg" alt="subscription gift" width="2000" height="2000">
Would you like to give a gift to someone who keeps giving? Try a box with a subscription. It is simpler than ever to express your gratitude, from the monthly Netflix fix to news and magazines. The charm of subscription boxes is that everyone has something for them! Often, it doesn't need to be costly. It might be a subscription to a magazine (on a subject they'd be interested in), pet food, snack samples, or something they'd like. On an ongoing basis, this makes the workers feel respected.
 
<h2>8. Gym Passes:</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16180" title="gym pass gift" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/gym-pass-gift.jpg" alt="gym pass gift" width="850" height="487">
Gym passes offer the perfect way for any employee who loves to get healthy or is inclined to follow a healthier lifestyle to help them get started. Since healthier workers are more active, satisfied, and energetic, this type of gratitude would also benefit the organization.
You're sure to get them a gift that makes them feel appreciated when you take the time to find a gift that is in line with the personality and desires of your employee. You just have to go for a gift card sometimes, and that's great, too. They are the preferred item for most employees and one of the most common presents, despite the fact that gift cards can feel impersonal.]]>

    <title>Best And Unique Gifts Ideas For Your Little Princess/Daughter!</title>
    <author>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16153 size-full" title="Best Gifts For Daughter" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Best-Gifts-For-Daughter.png" alt="Best Gifts For Daughter" width="1000" height="596">It is definitely a blessing to have a daughter, but it can be a real challenge to raise a little girl with high self-esteem in a world filled with digitally enhanced photos of perfect people. The burden of building the self-confidence of a daughter falls first on the shoulders of the parents.
There are a lot of things to take into account here, of course, but we will begin by complimenting them more on who they are and what they are great at. This way, without finding approval in a weekly fashion magazine, we can ensure that our daughters acknowledge their real value. Many parents would understand the excitement that comes with raising a baby. She is not only important but is also the beginning of her mother and father's joy and pride.
A daughter will still remember to care for her parents even when she gets married. A parent is always a wonderful feeling and if blessed with a kid, it is not possible to describe happiness in words. She is the family princess. She is the multi-tasking girl who not only studies but also handles side-by-side the entire work of the family. A daughter is every parent's best friend, and friends always deserve the best. Therefore, surprise your daughter with some special gifts.
Some of the following gifts are a way of encouragement for your girl, some describe a parent's pure love, and some are simple reminders that raising a daughter is probably your best, whatever success you may have to date. With one of these super thoughtful (and even some funny) gift ideas, show your daughter just how amazing she is.
<em>It can really be a jungle out there when it comes time to find out what you should get her for her special upcoming birthday, Christmas holiday, or "just because." Basically, she already has everything and, well, she's likely to eye-roll whatever gift you send her, depending on her age. To stop that, we'll help you out.</em>
<h2>1. Birthday Gift Basket Box:</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16154" title="Birthday Gift Basket Box:" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6H8rtf59SC297YOJeDMa_LifesAWaveRD-4.jpg" alt="Birthday Gift Basket Box:" width="680" height="453">
Your daughter's birthday is an occasion for you to celebrate her and to express to her the wonderful feelings you have for her. Without a doubt, she is one of the best special presents for her birthday. In a single surprise box, these presents are elegantly wrapped and range from tasty birthday treats to beauty essentials. This gift is one of the best girls' birthday presents, mostly because it has the stuff they love, which means your daughter's going to love it.
<h2><strong>2. leather Journal:</strong></h2>

Your daughter's dream gift should also feel luxurious. Genuine leather and practical notebook is a leather journal. A journal is crafted in a compact size that makes it easy to carry in a bag and large enough to provide enough room for writing. This gift will be enjoyed by your daughter as she uses it in her day to day life.
<h2>3. Instant Camera:</h2>

    <title>Missing Your Fine Collection Due To The Coronavirus Pandemic? Hang on!</title>

      <![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16001" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wardrobe-by-voylla.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="550"></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the fashion industry has stalled. Stores are shut and fashion weeks have been canceled and while shopping from online stores still goes on, the industry has still taken a major hit. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A major chunk of the Indian fashion industry belongs to women’s apparel and clothing for women and since the industry is on lockdown, the production of new designs has been stalled for the foreseeable future.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Indian clothing for women is majorly dependent on occasion wear and since the pandemic is preventing the largescale celebrations of occasions, there is no widescale change in the fashion industry. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As many retail stores are temporarily or permanently closing their doors for customers, <a href="https://www.voylla.com/apparel?utm_source=voylla-blog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=anchor-text">online shopping for women’s apparel</a> has certainly gone up by a great margin. Another contributing factor to this is the unavailability of the trial of clothes in physical shops, but there is a downside to this. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Indian apparel is something that we prefer to buy after seeing the finished product and shopping for that online may prove to be quite difficult as customers have no idea of how the final product looks. In spite of the one drawback, online shopping for women’s apparel is an alternative that women opt for. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While we miss the experience of raiding stores and buying new clothes of different patterns, styles, and designs, the fashion industry is trying to keep up with the changing situations. Many brands for women’s clothing have come up with masks matching their apparel and a sale of ready to wear clothes. While clothing is not considered as a part of essential commodities, it comprises a huge chunk of the countries revenue and hence it is expected that the industry will be allowed to resume soon. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Indian designers, especially those of women’s apparel are practitioners of slow fashion, i.e. the one item of clothing being worked on by multiple people before reaching the final wearer, and this will help create employment once the industry resumes. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Indian women’s apparels are timeless and are in demand throughout the year and it will be easier to gain back the customer base once the industry resumes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, a wide range of women’s apparel is readily available in online stores. The one positive outcome is that this break has given designers the chance to recalibrate and rethink the direction in which Indian fashion is heading. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A “Handmade in India” campaign has been started in order to integrate ethnic and local designs, done by local craftsmen into the designs and styles of our apparels. Handcrafted products will have more value in a post COVID world and will hence garner more price on sale abroad. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
<a href="https://www.voylla.com/apparel?utm_source=voylla-blog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=product-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15957 size-full" title="women apparel by voylla" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Untitled-design.jpg" alt="women apparel by voylla" width="1200" height="626"></a></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, when we look for Indian women’s apparel specifically, there are more indigenous and individual websites that sell a wide variety of occasion wear. Designer specific websites like Ritu Kumar, Rohit Bal, Anita Dongre and more have high-end clothes available for sale on their personal websites.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> For more casual, ready to wear women’s apparel, multiple online stores exist, and they sell all of the latest trends and designs. Meanwhile, there are so many online websites that have all kinds of women’s clothing available. There are classic websites like Myntra, Amazon, Ajio, etc that have a wide range of clothing for women. </span>
Shopping from them may not provide us with the authentic store shopping experience but the quality and size of the clothes can be judged using the size chart and customer reviews. This way, we also get a much wider range of products, and consequentially have more options to choose from. A few online stores are Utsav Fashion, House of Indya, Biba, Craftsvilla, etc.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple google searches on women’s clothing will provide a ginormous list of online stores that sell readymade and trendy apparel. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, even though it seems insignificant to dress up while staying at home or for working from home, it is important for us to put in at least a little effort into our appearance as this has a way of drastically improving our mood and helping us get a change from the routine we have been living since the past five months of lockdown. </span>

 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dressing up for work or even otherwise will provide us with a necessary change from the mundane routine that we have accustomed ourselves to. </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A change from daily pajamas will also help us boost productivity as with more outgoing clothes, the urge to laze around goes away and results in a nudge towards getting more productive work done. </span></li>

Palazzos for women are not a modern trend though. They became popular among women in the late 1960s. During that time certain restaurants restricted the entry of women wearing trousers, which were considered inappropriate by certain sections of the society. This was a major issue for women who did not want to wear skirts that were in fashion then. To come up with a solution for this, some women started wearing Palazzos as evening wear so that they don’t get banned by restaurants. Palazzo pants are different from bell bottoms because they flare out evenly to the ankle from the waist

    <title>13 Fashion Forward Designer Kurti Trends OF 2020</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kurtis is a part of the quintessential style of an Indian woman and the variety in this women’s apparel is ever-changing with the evolving style and fashion sense. This type of women’s clothing is very comfortable and is widely worn in India by women of all age groups. </span>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15915" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/types-of-kurtis.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we try adapting to the western culture and trends in our daily lives, aspects of these have also been integrated into the designing of Kurtis. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Floor-length Kurtis-</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15903 size-full" title="Floor Length Flared Style Kurta" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Floor-Length-Flared-Style-Kurta.jpg" alt="Floor Length Flared Style Kurta" width="752" height="940"></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These Kurtis are rapidly flooding the markets and online stores today and are widely sought out items in clothing for women today. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The long, floor-length Kurti is generally made with a flowy material. The design is made in a way that the blouse is perfectly fitted, and the rest of the fabric flows around the body, reaching the ankles and sometimes the floor. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Long Slit Kurtis-</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15904 size-full" title="digital print Layered Style Traditional Anarkali Kurta" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Digital-Print-Layered-Anarkali-Kurta.jpg" alt="digital print Layered Style Traditional Anarkali Kurta" width="752" height="940"></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This design adds a whole new look to the otherwise simple Kurti. The slit can either be located on the front or side and can either be waist high or thigh-high. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the Kurtis with thigh-high slits is more in trend. This type of Kurtis can be paired with pants, jeans, palazzos, and even dhoti style pants. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This style leans more toward the indo-western form of women’s apparel and is very versatile. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Jacket Kurtis-</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15917" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Jacket-Kurtis.jpg" alt="" width="381" height="618"></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> A Jacket Kurti is nothing but a normal floor-length Kurti with an outer jacket or shrug to it. Most of the time, the length of the jacket matches the Kurti and is kept floor length. Monotone jackets are widely used to match printed Kurtis and these are paired with leggings. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Anarkali slit Kurti-</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15907 size-full" title="Layered Style Traditional Anarkali Kurta" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Layered-Style-Traditional-Anarkali-Kurta.jpg" alt="Layered Style Traditional Anarkali Kurta" width="752" height="940"></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of Kurti is a modern twist to the classic flared Anarkali. A high front slit runs through the front of the Kurti. This is worn with pants and the design makes the outfit more flexible and easier to carry. These outfits can be ideally paired with high heels. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. A-Line Kurti-</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15909 size-full" title="A-Line Geometric Print Kurta" src="https://blog-admin.voylla.com/voylla-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/A-Line-Geometric-Print-Kurta.jpg" alt="A-Line Geometric Print Kurta" width="752" height="940"></span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the simple Kurti that we wear and are used to wearing. These are very easily found in online stores, with a wide variety. The design is made in a way that is fitted from above and loosens slightly towards the bottom, giving an A shape. It suits all body types and is generally worn with leggings. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Collared Kurti- </span></h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A collared Kurti adds a little more class to the simple Kurti. The collar gives the apparel a formal twist with the shirt style collar. The size of the collar completely depends on the person choosing to wear the item of women’s clothing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These Kurtis can be designed in a multitude of sleeves, which range from full to sleeveless. The Kurti does not necessarily have buttons and can be used for office wear as it is a fusion of a shirt and a kurta. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Shirt Style Kurtis-</span></h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are different from the collared Kurtis because along with the collar, buttons run down the length of the dress. The sleeves can be rolled up and cuffed. These are also categorized as formal outfits and widely used in an office environment. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. Layered Kurti-</span></h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These Kurtis are stitched with an additional layer of fabric stitched under the basic Kurti. This helps in adding a little more volume to the outfit. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dress may or may not have a slit and are widely available on online stores like Myntra. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">9. Single Shoulder Designer-</span></h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most stylish Kurti designs of the year is the unique one-shoulder, Kurtis. These Kurtis are generally long and flared and drape over one shoulder while exposing the other. They sometimes have high choker collars and can be worn with both jeans and leggings. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">10. Playful Hems-</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Playful hems are the new style in this ethnic clothing for women. This design helps integrate the Kurti with a bohemian style and twist with the asymmetric cut. These are generally cut out as high-lows, (high in the front and lower from behind) and are often worn with Dhoti style pants. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">11. Festive cuts- </span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The modern kurtas go short in these designs, often above the knees, and are designed with strappy sleeves. Such Kurtis can be paired with palazzos, skirts, and shararas. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">12. Fusion Tops and Short Kurtis- </span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are generally short and flared Kurtis that come just below the hip. They are mostly paired with jeans.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">13. Side Slit Kurtis- </span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the front slit, this Kurtis has a slit on any one side. The length may vary from mid-calf to floor and these are generally paired with leggings. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All these designs can very easily be integrated with each other and be mixed and matched to form beautiful outfits. These designs are sold on online stores and are widely available items in women’s apparel. Off-late, funky arts, theme prints, quotes, and embellishments have started appearing as designs on the Kurtis.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A few trends that made their way over from 2019 are Kurtis with different shoulder designs (cold-shoulder or off-shoulder) and the popular denim Kurtis. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pantone color is the color of 2020 and many of these designs are available in this color. The shade is very soothing and a tropical breather for a country like India. Other than this, the classic blue has been an all-time favorite in ethnic clothes. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As of today, all these patterns of Kurtis are widely available in online stores.</span>
